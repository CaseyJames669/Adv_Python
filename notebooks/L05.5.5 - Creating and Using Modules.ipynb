Rather than writing test code, testing the function, and then deleting the test code, the code is \"sequestered\" with an if statement so that it is not executed when the module is imported, but only when the module is run directly (as a python script).  By maintaining the code in the module file, the functions may be retested after subsequent changes are made to the module.  \n",
