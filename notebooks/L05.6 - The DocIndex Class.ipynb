      "### Step 2:  Construct the \"template for your function\n",
      "> Most of this step has been done for you .. read carefully and identify the following:  \n",
      ">> * We know we are going to use the word module, so import that now.  In general, you may determine that other modules must be imported as you are developing algorithms for the methods ... this is a \"work in progress\".  \n",
      "* Write the class definition heading and the docstring class description for it.\n",
      "* From the description of desired behavior / operations in the table above, construct \"stub\" method definitions that include:  \n",
      ">>> * method heading, complete with anticipated parameter list  ,\n",
      ">>> * docstring documentation with short description, preconditions, and postconditions,  \n",
      ">>> * this is a \"stub\" .. i.e. a placeholder, for now, so its only statement is **pass** ... remember to remove this when  you supply code.  \n",
      "\n",
      ">> * Supply unit test code.  \n",
      "Test driven development helps ensure that your methods don't deviate from their agreed-upon/intended function.  Again, the methods and their unit tests are \"works in progress\" and subject to review/change (after agreement among the parties involved).  \n",
      "Of course, sections of the unit test may need to be commented out until you have coded methods to address what the unit test code is testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3:  Write the code for the initializer (\\_\\_init\\_\\_).  \n",
      "> This is where you initialize all of your instance data attributes.  \n",
      ">> * **_lines** is a list of the lines in the document\n",
      "* **_label** is a string containing the document's name\n",
      "* **_index** is a dict {word:lines} indicating on which lines of the document the word apears  \n",
      "\n",
      "> Note:  This is sufficient for maintaining the data and supporting all the class' methods.\n",
      "<p>\n",
      "At this point, you can't test much, but you can find errors in the syntax, etc by simply creating an instance of the class.  \n",
      "**NOTE:**  In order to be able to **import word**, you must have a **word.py** or **word.pyc** (compiled with python 3.2) in your notebook folder.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4:  Write code to display the contents of a class instance.  \n",
      "> Write the **\\_\\_str\\_\\_** and **\\_\\_repr\\_\\_** methods.  \n",
      "These will give you a sense of whether or not your data is being correctly communicated and stored.\n",
      "Uncomment the unit test code lines that test these methods and inspect their output to verify that your object correctly represents/reports the data it is charged with maintaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5:  Continue implementing methods in an order that allows them to be tested after implementation.\n",
      "> In the current problem, you will probably want to save the implementation of **get_context** until last.  Though it doesn't depend on other methods, you will want to be certain that your representation of the data is correct before attacking this one.  \n",
      "Don't make the mistake of coding all your methods and then testing.  \n",
      "Often the effects of methods are interdependent and the more code you have to test, the more difficult it is to locate the source of an error.  \n",
      "At times it may be necessary to even test a section of code for a method ... just as it is for any other function or script.  In those instances, you may find it beneficial to test code snippets in a Python shell (or a notebook cell).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6:  Code the 'get_context' method  \n",
      "> Considerations in this method are:\n",
      ">> * **get_context** is a generator function and returns an iterator which produces **contexts**.\n",
      "* Each **context** is a **string** composed of (numbered) lines from the text.\n",
      "* When constructing the contexts for a given word, you need to use the line the word occurs on and surrounding lines ... you need to be sure those lines actually exist.  (Eg. if your word is on line 0, there will BE NO preceeding lines).  \n",
      "Look at the python documentation for **enumerate**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7:  Migrate your code to a module file\n",
      "> About this time, your testing is being constrained by the limits of the ipython notebook environment.  \n",
      "You need to construct a file that you can execute from the command line so that you can use the unit test code that you created for your last assignment (which uses the python built-in **input** function.  \n",
      ">> * Copy your code into a text editor, add your (required) file header and module documentation, and save it to your project folder.\n",
      ">> * Copy some text files to your project folder for testing your module.\n",
      ">> * Perform further testing / debugging / modifying."
