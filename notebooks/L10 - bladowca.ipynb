      "Eg.  \n",
      "    * A **list** is a sequence of arbitrary data items that may be directly accessed.  Lists may have other properties, depending on how they are described.    \n",
      "    * To the University's records office, a **student** may be composed of other data of already defined types: a name(str), address (str), student ID (int), list of classes taken, number of credits (float), gpa (float).  To another entity, say food services, a **student** may be represented quite differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "> * **description of operations** on the data - what can we ask this data item to do?  This describes the **behavior** of something that belongs to this ADT.  This describes **What you can expect the ADT to do**.\n",
      "Eg.\n",
      "    * What you can do with a list depends on what operations are defined for it.  We are familiar with the behavior and operations on a Python **list**, but other paradigms may have more flexible or restrictive descriptions of a **list**.\n",
      "    * We may be able to initialize a **student**, ask and change the students name and address, add completed courses to the course list ... (which in turn affects the number of credits and gpa), and ask the student to report any of this academic information.  \n",
      "\n",
      "> * with **no regard for implementation**.  This says that **HOW** the first requirements of an ADT are implemented are of no concern.  \n",

      "    * How the individual members of a **list** are stored in memory, how an item can be removed from the middle of an existing list, or how, when you ask a list to sort itself, that task is accomplished are not germane to the **ABSTRACT** description of the data.\n",
      "    * When a completed academic class is added to our **student**, how that students representation in memory is affected and how its credits completed and gpa are updated are not of concern.  It only matters that we understand precisely what is expected of us and what we will get from the **student** if we decide to use that representation.  \n",

      "It **encapsulates** the data representation and operations into a single entity which exists independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ADT describes an **interface** between the user's domain and that of the programmer, who must provide the expected functionality.\n",
      "> * The **user** need no longer be concerned with the details of **HOW** the tasks are accomplished and can concentrate on using the interface to provide script functionality ... which may now be reduced to a very simple algorithm and a few lines of code.\n",
      "> * The developer need not be concerned with the specific application.  In fact, if well written, the software that implements the ADT will be independent of any specific application.
