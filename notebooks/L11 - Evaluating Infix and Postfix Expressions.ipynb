      "In **Lesson 10 - Classes**, we created the **collect** module containing the **Stack** and **Queue** classes and unit test code for both.  \n",
      "In this lesson, we will write an application script that makes use of the classes in that module.  \n",

      "## Infix and Postfix notations  \n",
      "Arithmetic expression notations are categorized by the position of the operator relative to the operands.\n",
      "> * In **infix**, operators are **between** the operands, with operator presidence, associativity, and grouping with '(' and ')' determining the order of operations.  \n",
      "> * In **postfix** notation, operators **follow** the operands (hence post-) and the sequential ordering of the operands and operators determines the order in which operations are performed.  When an operator is encountered in a left-to-right scan of the expression, it is applied to the two operands immediately preceeding it.  The three tokens are then replaced by the result and the scan continues.  \n",
      "> * In **prefix** notation, operators **preceed** the operands.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this lesson we are concerned with conversion of **infix** notation to **postfix** and evaluation of **postfix** expressions.  As we will see, **postfix** representation is convenient for algorithmic evaluation because of the low processing and storage requirements."
