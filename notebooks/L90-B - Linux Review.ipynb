Note that you need to refer back to Figure 1 to get the absolute pathname of barneyr's Home folder (/home/barneyr) and then extend that by the path from it (labeled Home in Figure 2) to the README file.\n",

To specify the folder labeled \"screens\", the path we trace from the working folder to target must go UP the hierarchy before going DOWN.  We need special terminology for indicating relative paths that must traverse UP the hierarchy.  \n",
